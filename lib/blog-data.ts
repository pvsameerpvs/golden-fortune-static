        <li><strong>Select a Legal Structure:</strong> Common structures include Limited Liability Company (LLC), Sole Establishment, and Civil Company.</li>
        <li><strong>Register Your Trade Name:</strong> Your company name must be unique and comply with the UAE's naming conventions.</li>
        <li><strong>Obtain Initial Approval:</strong> This confirms that the UAE government has no objection to your business establishing itself in the country.</li>
        <li><strong>Draft the MOA/LSA:</strong> Depending on your legal structure, you'll need a Memorandum of Association (MOA) or a Local Service Agent (LSA) agreement.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>Setting up a mainland company is a strategic move for long-term growth. With the right guidance and understanding of the local regulations, your business can thrive in Dubai's competitive market.</p>
